## About Portal Puzzle

Portal Puzzle was created as a project for the [Flutter Puzzle Hack](https://flutterhack.devpost.com/). The classic 15 slide puzzle is
fun until you figure out (or see on internet) how to easily solve it every time.
When I had a chance to create the puzzle in the digital form, I thought: why not do something which is not a strict copy of the "analog" box with tiles.
Why not allow those tiles to move through "portals"... The rest is history (git log).
